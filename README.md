# Graph-Algorithms
Allows users to create graphs and run a variety of algorithms on their graphs. Graphs are classes in **node.py** and represent edges with defaultdictionary. Algorithms were implemented myself and are based on the design of Graph.

Algorithms:
- Floyd's Cycle Determining/Locating Algorithm
- Breadth-First Traversal
- Depth-First Traversal
- Algorithm to determine whether graph is Binary Tree or Binary Search Tree or not
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

# Running Code
No dependencies required. Python3 is required. Run ```python3 main.py```.

# Future Changes
- Create terminal-based UI for user to create their own graph.
- Add more algorithms (path finding, flow).
- Create into web app for easier accessibility and cleaner UI.
- Add visualization so that user can see what is happening during each step of the algorithm.
